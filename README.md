# midi-to-keypress

App for converting midi to key presses. Built with Electron and React.

I've primarily made this to be able to play GuildWars2 Instruments with a midi keyboard.

Primarily developing on windows 10, so support on other OSs is untested, though theoretically possible at some point.

## building on windows
