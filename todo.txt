- Latency still an issue, but a bit better after swapping to robotjs
- Auto change octaves when playing a note on a different octave?
-- ie, gw2 instruments have a set octave you need to change through
- robotjs chord issue. Any chance I can batch notes within 10ms together?
- keymap selector
- UI that shows a piano and keypresses
- Better ui for configuring note->key map
- Automatically play through a song
