Current "roadmap" of upcoming changes

v0.2

- key switches for octaves (when in not auto octave mode)
- buttons for manually shifting the internal octave
- keymap selector with a few options

v0.3

- Better ui for configuring note->key map

future ideas

- UI that shows a piano and keypresses
- Automatically play through a song
- Mac build
- Send different note ranges to different game clients?
  -- Like if multiboxing multiple instruments
  -- May be against terms of service :(
